The idea is to create a dictionary which has the character as the key and the corresponding count as the value.
Then we iterate over the string to check the count of character in the dictionary and return first index which has a count of 1.
If not we return -1.


class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        l= {} 
        for i in s:
            if i in l:
                l[i]+=1
            else:
                l[i]=1
        for i in range(0,len(s)):
            if l[s[i]]==1:
                return i
        return -1
