list slicing and sort method in python. L[-k]

Confusion as which element is to be returned. So I started a set, but later realised that it is not distinct but largest


class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        s = sorted(nums)   
        return s[-k]
