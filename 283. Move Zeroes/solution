The idea is to have a count of non zero elements in the array.
Once we have the count replace all the elements from that count to length of the array to zeros.







class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]!=0:
                nums[count] = nums[i] # swap the elements
                count+=1              #need not worry about all the zeros right away.
        for i in range(count,len(nums)):
            nums[i]=0
