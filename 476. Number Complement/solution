This is a bit easy.
we iterate over the binary representation of the digits and take its complement.



class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        x = "{0:b}".format(num) 
        y = ""  #This was a bit difficult for me to come up with
        for i in x:
            y+=  str(1- int(i))
        return int(y,2) # Carefully look into this in the future.
