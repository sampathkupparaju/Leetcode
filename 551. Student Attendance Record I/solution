I learnt that if you want to check continuous occurance of a particular charcater more than a number, just check once if we have
one more than that number in the string



class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        count =0
        for i in s:
            if i=='A':
                count+=1
        if count>1 or "LLL" in s:  # more than twice the student cant be rewarded, so check LLL in string
            return False
        return True
