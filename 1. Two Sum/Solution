This one took a lot of time for me to figure out.

1. Store the complement of each number in the list as a key in dictionary with indices as values.
So, for list[0] = num, the key would be (target - num) and the value would be 0
2. Iterate over the list, we see if the number's complement is already present in the dictionary. If not, insert the 
element into the dictionary with key and value as specified above.




class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        result ={}
        for index, value in enumerate(nums): # generates tuples with index and value
            if value in result:
                return [result[value], index] 
            else:
                result[target-value]= index # Insert elements
        return
