1. Minimum number would be the length of the String.
2. Create an array to store results.
3. Can be divided into 2 categories. String's length less than 3 and greater than 3.
4. For string's length less than 3 it is just enough to check for the equality of chars at i and j.
5. For string's length greater than 3, we have to check the equality of chars at i and j. In addition we have to check if 
   the string between i+1 and j-1 to be a palindrome.
6. For counting the number of palindromes, we have to add an additional condition to see if the difference between i and j is
    >0
