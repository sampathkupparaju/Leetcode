Bit manipulation.

1. If we use XOR between two binary numbers we get result as if they were added except for a carry.

For example,

      0010
    + 1000
      1010
2. Now for carry if we use & between two binary numbers we get a result which needs to be shifted left once. 
3. Left shift and add it to what we have after using XOR.
4. Repeat this until the carry shifted left after each iteration becomes 0



class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        
        
        while(b!=0)
        {
            int carry = a & b;
            a = a^b;
            b = carry << 1;
            
        }
        return a;
    }
}
